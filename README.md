# Improvement In The Preparation Of Semester Evaluation Reports
The project sought to improve the evaluation process of the semester evaluations done by the semester coordinators. Feedback was categorized by the predicted sentiment which was found by using a combination of an lstm network and a statistical keyword approach. A JavaFX GUI was created to give an impression of how such a tool can be used.
